Missing:

- "created on" field should be set as today automatically --- fix

- "All Tasks" should show all tasks in all categories and types of tasks --- fix

- Please make the date dynamic. --- fix.

- "Are you sure you want to delete" screen the "Yes" is white against the white background and cannot be seen. --- fix

- Total time today doesn't reflect total time today. --- fix

- For Current Task, green button should be "Complete" --- fix

- Other than "Personal" and "Work", the routes for the other categories are not working. --- fix

- Users should be allowed to create a new task without specifying a category, and this task will go into the "Inbox". --- fix

- in the screen where the user is creating a new task, delete the time display for the stop watch because it's not doing anything - so just allow "Set a stopwatch" checkbox --- fix

- Even if the user hasn't selected the stopwatch when creating the task (i.e. if the user only selects a countdown timer or a Pomodoro clock), clicking the "clock" icon of a current task can still display the stopwatch (i.e. the time elapsed) for the Current Task. --- fix

- "counting up timer" and "Pomodoro timer" tasks are not working --- fix

- The checkboxes of the Completed tasks are not currently checked, and cannot be unchecked. Please allow the user to uncheck Completed Tasks, which will make the "Completed Tasks" "Ongoing Tasks. --- fix

- Timer for the Ongoing Tasks should not be running. If a task's timer is running, it should be an Ongoing Task - and there should only be one Ongoing Task at one time (with the timer running) --- fix

- "Schedule for later" button is not working --- fix

======== do it fix =======

Issues and notes:

- Please add a way to delete and edit the name of a category (maybe create the 3 dots beside the name of the category in the Task Page for the user to click into and select delete?)

- On the "All Tasks', Inbox any category page, clicking any tag should filter out the tasks based on the tag

- Please find a way for the user to edit the time of the timer of the Current Task and the Ongoing Tasks

Mobile responsive:
- for the plus button, no need to have the option to select "New Category" - should go straight to the screen to create a new task.



The list is not all - please continue working on fixing the app. Thank you Rashedul.
